                        <h2 class=" link-body-emphasis mb-1">A Day in the Life: Hunting in the River</h2>
                        <p class="blog-post-meta">March 15, 99 million years ago by <a href="#">Spinosaurus</a></p>

                        <p>The river is calm today, but I know what lurks beneath the surface—giant fish, my primary source of food. With my long, crocodile-like snout, I wait patiently. This morning, I caught a 6-foot Onchopristis—a tricky catch, but its barbed snout is no match for my powerful jaws. Being semi-aquatic gives me an edge that most other dinosaurs lack. Fish aren’t the only thing out here though. I spotted a Sarcosuchus prowling the shallows. A fight between us would be brutal, but for now, we keep our distance.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>In these times, food is plentiful, but the seasons are changing, and soon, my territory will be tested. Smaller predators like the Carcharodontosaurus are a constant threat, though they rarely challenge me directly. I will need to travel farther upstream soon, where the fish are more abundant, and fewer rivals roam.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Reflections on My Rivals</h2>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            <p>“Carcharodontosaurus may be fast, but in the water, I reign supreme.”</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>My largest competitor on land, Carcharodontosaurus, is swift and deadly, with sharp teeth that can slice through prey in seconds. However, they are not adept in water, and that's where I have the upper hand. Territorial disputes are inevitable, but as long as I control the rivers, my supremacy remains uncontested. It’s a delicate balance of power.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Lessons from the Hunt</h3>
                        <p>Over time, I’ve learned to adapt. Fishing is an art, and patience is key. Here's what I’ve gathered:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stay close to the riverbanks where fish congregate.</li>
                            <li>Use my sail to regulate my body temperature while waiting for prey.</li>
                            <li>Strike swiftly, as any commotion in the water can scare the fish away.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Each hunt brings new challenges, but my instincts never fail me.</p>

                        <h2>Seasons in the Wetlands</h2>
                        <p>The wetlands are ever-changing. As the dry season approaches, the river shrinks, concentrating fish and forcing predators closer together. It is a time of tension. Migrating to safer grounds becomes essential, but leaving my territory behind is always a risk. I must be cautious of new rivals staking their claim while I am gone.</p>

                        <h2 class=" link-body-emphasis mb-1">The Dry Season: A Time of Scarcity</h2>
                        <p class="blog-post-meta">May 10, 99 million years ago by <a href="#">Spinosaurus</a></p>

                        <p>The dry season is brutal. The once-vast rivers have become shallow streams, and the fish have dwindled. The wetlands are now teeming with desperate predators. Some leave in search of food, but I stay. My size and strength give me the advantage over smaller dinosaurs, and my ability to catch what few fish remain means I can survive here—barely. It’s a dangerous gamble, but one I must take to defend my territory.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"A Spinosaurus without its waters is like a fish out of water—lost and vulnerable."</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <h3>Survival Tactics</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stay close to the deepest parts of the river, where fish are more likely to remain.</li>
                            <li>Conserve energy by hunting only when necessary.</li>
                            <li>Avoid unnecessary confrontations with other large predators—it's a waste of energy.</li>
                        </ul>
